# Welcome

My name is Philippe Nadon. I enjoy many things such as software design and development, but this site focuses on 3D modelling, graphic design, typography, pixel art, and other artistic creations. Full disclosure: *The content on this site is purely for fun, and not for professional / career purposes*.

You can find my other content and links to them at [https://nadon.io](https://nadon.io).

Enjoy browsing the content on this site, and feel free to check out my other sites!
